<b>Q: Is there a demo available?</b><br>
A: Yes, check out the list of mirrors at <a href="http://www.3drealms.com/max/downloads.html" target="_blank">http://www.3drealms.com/max/downloads.html</a>
<p>
<b>Q: Is there a patch available?</b><br>
A: Yes, you can get it at <a href="http://www.3dfiles.com/patches/maxpayne.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.3dfiles.com/patches/maxpayne.shtml</a>
<p><b>Q: When is the game going to be released?</b><br>
A: It's out, go get a copy :)
<p><b>Q: Why did it take so damn long?</b><br>
A: Developing a game and the game's technology takes a long time. Also, content-rich, detailed, interactive, story-filled games cannot be made in less than two years, no way, no how. So taking three years to make a triple-A title isn't surprising. What is surprising is why any developer would want to make anything less than a triple-A game ;)
<p><b>Q: Is there a demo available?</b><br>
A: Yes, check out the great list of mirrors on 3D Realms' <a href="http://www.3drealms.com/max/downloads.html" target="_blank">dowbloads page.</a>
<p><b>Q: Does Max Payne require a 3D accelerator?</b><br>
A: MAX-FX engine is built from the ground up to take full advantage of 3D acceleration. There is no software renderer in the game.
<p><b>Q: What about OpenGL?</b><br>
A: We're supporting DirectX only, because of its much broader support, which will greatly lessen compatibility issues for players. And DirectX's current state allows for all the speed and functionality of OpenGL.
<p><b>Q: What are the system requirements?</b><br>
A: Minimum (minimum graphical detail):
       <b><blockquote> 450 MHz Intel/AMD Processor (or compatible)<br>
        96 MB RAM <br>
        16 MB Direct3D Compatible Graphics Card <br></blockquote></b>
 <p>
Recommended (Medium graphical detail):
        <b><blockquote>700 MHz Intel/AMD Processor (or compatible) <br>
        128 MB RAM <br>
        32 MB Direct3D Compatible Graphics Card </blockquote></b><br>

<p><b>Q: What about consoles?</b><br>
A: Max Payne for the PlayStation 2 was recently announced.  And Max Payne for Xbox is set to hit shelves in November 2001.
<p><b>Q: Is there going to be a Linux version of the game?</b><br>
A: Not likely.
<p><b>Q: Is there going to be a Mac version of the game?</b><br>
A: Possibly, but it's not under development.
<p><b>Q: Does Max Payne take full advantage of Athlon processors?</b><br>
A: Yes, and the performance is great.
<p><b>Q: What about Pentium III?</b><br>
A: MAX-FX is fully optimized for PIII's SSE instruction set.
<p><b>Q: Can I customize Max Payne, what about Total Conversions etc.?</b><br>
A: 3 editors are released with the game.  You can get your hands on MaxED, ActorFX and ParticleFX. In addition editing the game is easy as it's 100% based on a messaging system that can be opened to players.
<p><b>Q: Is the storyline linear or dynamic?</b><br>
A: Linear. Quality before quantity. We feel that one strong plotline is better than, say, three weak ones.
<p><b>Q: Does Max Payne have a multiplayer mode?</b><br>
A: There is not a multiplayer mode. Originally we planned out full multiplayer functionality, but as we went further into the project we started to have so much cool stuff that work great in single player but wouldn't work in a multiplayer game that we changed the focus to single player only. There's plenty enough good multiplayer games out there, but the single player genre needs great games as well.
<p><b>Q: What about environment interactivity? Real world environment requires interactivity, right?</b><br>
A: The environments are extremely interactive. Our tools let us create interactive content very easily, and there is a  really high level of interacting with the environment.
<p><b>Q: So let me get this straight, I've read articles on Max that mention Remedy, 3DRealms, The Gathering of Developers, Rockstar Games, and even Neo and Rockstar Canada. Who's doing what?</b><br>
A: Remedy is developing the game, all technology, editors, art, sounds, the story, etc. have been done at Remedy office. 3DRealms is taking part in that development by helping out on content and gameplay matters, Scott, George and everyone at 3DR are outstanding hardcore game developers and we really dig working with them. The Gathering is the publisher of the PC version and was responsible for shipping all those Max Payne boxes to the shelves with Take2 handling European distribution.  Rockstar Games is the publishing label for the console versions of Max Payne, with Neo handling development of the Xbox version and Rockstar Canada handling development of the PlayStation 2 version.  It truly is a worldwide collaborative effort!
