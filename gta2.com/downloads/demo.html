Your Minimum Requirements To Play the GTA2 Demo Level are -

<ul>
<li>Pentium P200 or above<br>
<li>DirectX 6.1<br>
<li>Any Direct3D compatible video card (at least 4MB)  (support Voodoo cards aswell)<br>
<li>Any DirectSound compatible sound card<br>
<li>40Mb free drive space
</ul>

<p align="justify">
The demo features nefarious criminal activity from the Zaibatsu Corporation,
purveyors of the new wonder leisure activity, Zoom Zoom, the crazy Loonies,
a gang of nutters who have taken over the asylum, and the coolest street
gang this side of Tokyo, the Yakuza. The Zaibatsu wear black, and run
things in town, leaving other gangs to fight for the scraps. The Yakuza
wear blue, drive great cars, and have the best equipment. The Loonies wear
surgical green, and are anarchic hedonists who hate anyone that tries to
organise things or suppress their massive consumption of recreational
substances.

<p align="justify">
Each gang has it's own particular interests, aims, and above all, hatreds.
These are too complex to go into in any detail here. Suffice to say, the
easiest way to get respect from these psychos is to kill their worst
enemies. None of the missions in the demo require you to have earned much
respect, as they are all missions designed to test your loyalty and
competency. However, if a gang particularly dislikes, you'll find visiting
their part of town a reasonably hair raising experience.

<p align="justify">
To earn the respect of the Loonies, cause some mahem in the Yakuza part of
town.

<p align="justify">
To earn the respect of the Zaibatsu go and abuse some Loonies.

<p align="justify">
To earn the respect of The Yakuza teach the Zaibatsu Corporation some
really dirty business practices.
