"The main difference between P.C and PlayStation is that on PlaySation we obviously have less power to throw things around, so we've reduced the number of cars and peds that appear on screen. Some bits of code have been simplified to take up less memory and processor time. There is more we can do with the lighting effects because lighting is pretty straightforward on PSX, but they'll get added in at the end.

<p align="justify">
<b>How will this effect the experience?</b><br>
It just tones things down a tiny amount - there's still the freedom, the missions, the ways of earning money - and of course, the innumerable number of ways people can be irritated. Some of the level of detail is lost, but it's not noticeable because the Playstation has to run in a lower resolution anyway.

<p align="justify">
<b>How is the game being converted to P.S.X.?</b><br>
We're developing for the two platforms simultaneously through the wonders of SourceSafe, which means as soon as we put something into the PC version all the PSX guys have to do is a recompile and they've got the latest stuff as well!"
