<h3>Chapter Three - A Confusing Riddle</h3>

<p>
Tuesday 9.45am
<p align="justify">
A white walled room somewhere
<br>
Well, thatï¿½s the understatement of the decade, I think. For those of you who 
ainï¿½t sure whatï¿½s a goinï¿½ on, join the club, and pay your subscription. 
Minï¿½s a scotch on the rocks, which is precisely where I am. On the rocks. 
Not in Scotland. So, I gets warned off <a href="valdez.html" target="main">
Valdez</a>, while at the same time, Iï¿½m 
told  to watch out for an Icelandic guy, who my 
not-as-sharp-as-a-lump-o-cork side kick tells me is a Scientist. 
<a href="../scientists/scientists.html" target="_new">The 
Scientist</a> runs a farm full o geneticised wonder beings in town somewhere, 
and heï¿½s a lookinï¿½ for assistance, because his geneticly perfect 
super-beasts (Iï¿½ve heard tell that theyï¿½re somethinï¿½ like that broad on TV 
only with better legs, and itï¿½s all real, and the guys look like a right 
bunch of fairies) are perfect in every way - looks, brains, biceps, even got 
a bigger soul than you or I, (souls not beinï¿½ the most important thing in my 
line oï¿½ work - detection - or my line oï¿½ leisure - broads and booze) - but 
these wonder beings ainï¿½t so good against colds or the flu. Turns out they 
die when exposed to either. A right bunch of lightweights. At least thatï¿½s 
what my assistant told me on the phone the other day.

<p align="justify">
I, meanwhile, have been keeping very busy - Valdez said to investigate the 
Icelandic guy, some professor, only I didnï¿½t know where to begin. And then 
what should appear? Well, nothing as it turns out. But, weï¿½ve now got a 
mystery without a mystery and with three separate points of interest. On the 
one hand, thereï¿½s Valdez, fishier than a three week old halibut and twice as 
oily, then thereï¿½s Professor Lars Von Bastardson, our Icelandic Megalomaniac 
geneticist, then thereï¿½s these real scumbags Iï¿½ve begun to notice. Only, 
there ainï¿½t just one bunch of scumbags, thereï¿½s two. Firstly, weï¿½ve got 
these redneck hillbillys, who supply all the best Beanie, including this 
here bottle Iï¿½m drinking now, and then weï¿½ve got this gang, ho I can only 
call lunatics, which is lucky ï¿½cause they go by the name of <a href="../loonies/loonies.html" target="_new">The Loonies</a>. Run 
by a few nutters. Lunatics who took over the asylum. Now how they piece 
together I donï¿½t know, but my assistantï¿½s got a theory - he reckons itï¿½s due 
to this stuff Zoom Zoom - apparently ol Bastardson used to work at 
<a href="../zaibatsu/popup/zai_corporation.html" target="_new">Zaibatsu</a>, 
and the mutants he builds are particularly susceptible to the water supply 
if itï¿½s got any traces of Zoom Zoom in it, making them very keen on the 
mutant broads and thereby ruining the asexual genetically driven 
reporduction which Lars favours. At the same time, these Loonies canï¿½t get 
enough of the stuff (Zoom Zoom, not sex, although it turns out they canï¿½t 
get enough of that either), while the rednecks, with their beanie moonshine 
are threatening the sales of Zoom Zoom all over town. And the Loonies love 
Beanie too. Anyway, thatï¿½s my assistantï¿½s theory. Reckons we might be being 
set up because the government want to ban Zoom Zoom, while the Zaibatsu want 
to kill the <a href="../rednecks/rednecks.html" target="_new">Rednecks</a>, 
and destroy their beanie sills. So, Mr. Straight laced 
Senator whoï¿½s due to pay a visit to town in a few days is going to get 
killed in a massive bomb in the trailer park, were the rednecks live, and 
weï¿½re being set up as eco-terrorists. Well, blow me with a three year old 
hoover. Sounds a lot of stuff and nonsense.

<p align="justify">
Now, as for me, Iï¿½m in a spot of trouble. In a white cell. No visible means 
of escape. All from when I decided to go and pay these Loonies, and their 
boos, Gov. J. Rotten, a visit, and being ever so polite, they gave me what 
they called an Executive relief Cocktail. Well, I  can take me drink, but 
that, according to the system clock was three days agoï¿½ It seemde like a 
good idea at the time. Now, whereï¿½s that assistant of mine.
