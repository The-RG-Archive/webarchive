If one thing really amazed people in the original Grand Theft Auto it was
the audio - great music, and a really noisey city combined to make one of
the most responsive and entertaining aural environments yet unleashed on
video games. Then GTA: London 1969 re-inforced this point by winning a Bafta
for Best Audio with it's combination of cockney charm and West London
reggae. Now it's GTA2's turn. An all new audio engine, a host of personality
disc jockeys, and over two hours of original and classic music, including
two original mixes by Moving Shadow records. 
Here Colin Anderson and Craig Connor from the legendary DMA Audio department
fill us in. Then in the music section, we give you an exclusive preview of
the game's audio possibilities. 

<p align="justify">
Everyone wants GTA2 to sound as good as it possibly can, and no one wants
that more so than the Audio Department.

<p align="justify">
We are using several technologies we have developed here at DMA which no one
else in the industry is using that will make the audio in GTA2 significantly
better than it's predecessor.  Unfortunately this has a side-effect and that
is it creates substantially more work, and therefore takes considerably more
time, to design the sounds and implement them properly in the game.

<p align="justify">
For example, in the original GTA only 1 sample was used to generate the
sound of each vehicle.

<p align="justify">
By comparison in GTA 2 we are balancing 6 different sounds for each vehicle;
engine idling, engine revving, gear noise, tyre noise, close wind noise and
distant wind noise.  This is more than 6 times the work, because not only do
6 times the number of samples have to be generated per vehicle but each one
behaves differently as the car manoeuvres and so has to be controlled
separately.

<p align="justify">
This is the level of detail we are applying to all aspects of the audio.  In
addition to all the better quality sound effects that will be implemented in
the game here is a summary of the enhanced audio features we intend to
implement in the PC version of GTA 2:

<ul>
<li>An updated version of the DMAudio engine as featured in Wild Metal
Country.
<li>Dynamic Sample Layering (DSL) on objects.
<li>Support for all major 3D sound APIs - (Aureal, Creative Labs EAX,
Dolby Pro-Logic)
<li>Enhanced Police crime reporting system.
<li>More than an hour of brand new music modified to give an authentic
'radio' sound.
<li>Radio Stations based on geographical location and gang alliance.
<li>No pause when entering or exiting a vehicle.
<li>Different pedestrian comments depending on your status with a
particular gang.
</ul>

<p align="justify">
An updated version of the DMAudio engine as featured in Wild Metal Country.

<p align="justify">
Our new DMAudio engine which was used for the first time in Wild Metal
Country is the result of experience gained from implementing audio in DMA's
titles over the past 6 years.  It successfully addresses most of the
problems that are encountered by teams when trying to make games sound good
by allowing the Audio Programmers unhindered access to all the game
variables necessary for accurate control of sound.

<p align="justify">
This means the Audio Team have full control over all aspects of the in-game
sound which results in a better sounding product.

<p align="justify">
Dynamic Sample Layering (DSL) on objects.

<p align="justify">
Most objects in GTA 2 will be represented by what we call 'Compound Sounds'.
These are sounds perceived by the listener as one sound but which are
actually made up of multiple samples.  An example from Wild Metal Country
would be the player's tank.  Although the player hears the sound as 'a tank'
it is actually composed of individual, engine, gearbox, track, surface and
suspension samples.

<p align="justify">
The relative levels of each sample are varied with distance so that the
resulting sound is far more convincing than would otherwise be achievable.
The cars in GTA 2 will benefit most from this.

<p align="justify">
Support for all major 3D sound APIs - (Aureal, Creative Labs EAX, Dolby
Pro-Logic)

<p align="justify">
GTA2 will provide a full 3D soundscape for anyone with the appropriate
hardware. Aureal said after hearing the audio in Wild Metal Country "Wild
Metal Country is indeed a wonderful aural experience!  Great work!!".  We've
learned a lot from this and intend to make GTA2 even better.

<p align="justify">
Enhanced Police crime reporting system.

<p align="justify">
Crimes will be reported with a more informative structure enhancing the
player's illusion that he is being tracked by the police.  In addition to
reporting the location and type of crime committed we will also be able to
announce the colour and type of vehicle the suspect was last seen in and the
direction in which he was headed.

<p align="justify">
e.g. "All units in vicinity of north west Island City respond to a 1014.
Suspect is heading west in a light green saloon."

<p align="justify">
This will be tied in to the player aquiring a 'wanted' level.  At other
times a simpler "There's a 1024 in south Hackenslash" will suffice.  This
gives an audio cue of the player's wanted level increasing as well as the
visual feedback of another police head appearing at the top of the screen.

<p align="justify">
More than an hour of brand new music modified to give an authentic 'radio'
sound.

<p align="justify">
All the music in the game will be treated to sound as if it is being played
back from a car radio.  This will add more to the illusion of being in a
vehicle than the music in the original GTA which, although effective,
sounded like a CD being played over the top of the game.

<p align="justify">
Radio Stations based on geographical location and gang alliance.

<p align="justify">
The different radio stations for different type of vehicle was a popular
feature of the original game.  This time we will have radio stations
physically located within different areas of the city.  Stations on gang
turf will play hardcore gang music and will only broadcast over limited
range whereas the large commercial stations will broadcast over the whole
city playing their sickly-sweet pop tunes.

<p align="justify">
No pause when entering or exiting a vehicle.

<p align="justify">
By using a system of streamed Wav files rather than purely playing a CD
along with the game we have managed to eliminate the irritating pause that
occurred on some machines in the original game when a player stepped in or
out of a vehicle.  It also allows us to maintain a realtime element to radio
stations by enabling the tracks to keep playing after the player leaves a
vehicle so that when he returns to a vehicle with the same station it will
no longer be playing the same song.

<p align="justify">
It should also be noted that the music will not be able to be played from a
normal CD player.  This could be a benefit if it was deemed appropriate to
release a soundtrack CD later on.

<p align="justify">
Different pedestrian comments depending on your status with a particular
gang.

<p align="justify">
Gang peds will shout different comments at the player depending on his
respect level.  Friendly gangs will shout encouraging remarks like "Go get
'em buddy" while rival gangs will shout "Get the f**ker" before opening fire
