<font face="arial,univers,helvetica" size="2">'Ello, gorgeous! Yes, we could do with one of your kind to serve me peeled grapes in a loin cloth.  Oh, you think you're a bit of a boy do you? Somethin' of a would-be and might-yet-be, eh? Well, we'll see, we'll see. I've eaten more hard men, and tough kids than you've had hot dinners, sunshine. Tough guys? I shit 'em. But if you got somethin' special to offer, then we can maybe find you somethin' to do. There's always mess to be cleaned up in this line of work, and I'm always after a decent cleaner. This ain't a nice world, bleedin' filthy if you ask me, and if you didn't ask me, I'm tellin' you. It's soddin' filthy. So you got to be tough, as well as pretty, to get by. And me and Arch' have more than got by. We rule this filthy world, from top to bottom. 'Cause we do what needs to be done. We put up with idiots like ol' Harold, and upstarts like Parkinson, just as long as they don't tread on our toes, and don't do anythin', anythin' at all, to offend me ol' dear. 'Cause if anyone irritates the Duchess, they better have a very good doctor. And soon, she might be a Duchess, proper like, 'cause me an' Arch have started to mix with royalty. Met a lovely posh nob done the boozer out Chelsea way the other week. Lucan or somthin'. I don't know. But we look after many a one like him. Members of Parliament and all. And they look after us. That's how it works here. Only they better look after us proper, like, or I'll bite their bits off. Know what I mean? I'm sure you do, don't he, Arch? 'Cause London, these days, it ain't like it use to be. It's a filthy place. Government sold us down the river since that war. I mean, we bloody won it, didn't we?  And we'll win this war, 'cause there's a bit of trouble in town at the moment. Some little kid thinks he can hold Albert bloody Crisp to blackmail? I invented soddin' blackmail. Didn't I, Archie? Look, do you know where I can  get me a few blues? What do you say, Arch, like the look of this one? No, I ain't sure either.</font>
