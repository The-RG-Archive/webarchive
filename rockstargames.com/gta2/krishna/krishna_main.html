Why can't we all love each other? Well, the fact is, we can. Why can't we all be rich and beautiful? Well, the fact is we all are. Sometimes, it's hard to see the wood for the trees. Sometimes, the world we've built to make life better just makes it worst. What is more beautiful, the flowers in the valley, or the arms factory maiming children? What sounds sweeter, a lark's song, or the roar of a tank as it crushes a pro-democracy supporter mercilessly under its tracks?
</font><font size="3" color="#ffff66" face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
What is healthier, a breath of fresh air after a hard walk along the river of life, or sitting with your mouth stapled to an exhaust pipe? So, why does life sometimes seem hard? We know the answers to every question - yet deliberately get them wrong. The evils of the world are the evils of man. Cars, guns, pollution, alcohol, monogamy. 
</font><font size="2" color="#ffff66" face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
These are the things which destroy us. And the things which make us whole - peace, quiet, time, sleep, freedom, free love, and the generous rejection of the individual in favor of the community. Our spiritual leader, Master Lepus, a brilliant man and true, had a revelation. It saieth unto him: destroy that which destroys, kill that which kills, for what better way to fight fire, than with fire itself?" See the light, it burns bright within us all. But the fight must be fought with money and with muscle, for evil takes many forms.

So, you have three choices, carry on as before, living not a life but a perpetual death, stuck in your cars, living a life of poisonous monotony, or you can come and join us in person, spend some time in our blissful inner city retreat, right in the center of town, or simply send us your credit card details and we will happily deduct a sum we think will be enough to help you find nirvana. And your muscles and your money won't be wasted on the earthly indulgences of our leaders - are leaders' indulgences are to love too much, and to take full advantage of all of the pleasures of the natural world. Notfast cars, and alcohol, but herbal relaxation and the pleasures of the natural world. And we, are, make no mistakeabout it, men of peace, but deperate times call for desperate measures. Following the brutal "joy" killings of many of our members, celebrity killings with their mock cry of gouranga, we have taken up arms to destroy arms. We will conquer all that stands in our way.So join us today. What have you got to lose? Well, your hair, your fashion sense, all of your personal savings, wealth, spousal fidelity, one kidney, your personality, individuality and understanding of self, any family affiliations, personal affections or sense of humanity, but, all of these pathetic little sacrifices are in the quest for a greater good.
