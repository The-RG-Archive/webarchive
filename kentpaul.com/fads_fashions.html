        Well, there were loads of stupid things in the 80s, like having big hair or really narrow ties, but I wasn't
        going to talk about clothes. One thing that isn't so popular now is roller skating. But it was in Vice City. I
        always thought it was a 70s thing, and besides which, no self respecting man would ever go on roller skates, but
        this bird did and lots of men who thought they was birds did and all, but I've never been a fan of roller
        skating or whatever that stupid thing they do now is, as I'm not a pillock. Anyway, she's a pretty girl, and I
        should know. I had her. Probably.<br>
