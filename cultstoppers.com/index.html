					<p>It happened to us, and we were just two normal, needy, lost liberal arts graduates, from averagely dysfunctional white middle-class families, who fell for the rhetoric of a charismatic man at the end of the 1970s.</p>

					<p>People think it's only teenage runaways, middle-aged virgins and creepy high-school loners who fall victim to cults, but it can happen to anyone. Including you or your loved ones. Someone you know could suddenly disappear for a year and come back babbling gibberish.</p>
					<p>Most people don't realize they're in a cult until it's too late. You start off excited about some better way to live, then progress to worshipping some drug-ravaged sexagenarian psychopath, then progress to worshipping the penis of some drug-ravaged sexagenarian psychopath.</p>
					<p>One day you're smoking weed and knitting clothes in a utopian rural community; then suddenly it's 14 years later and you're standing in the middle of a burning barn with a cup of poison in your hand screaming "WHAT HAVE I DONE?!!" at the top of your lungs while people chant outside.</p>
					<p>Cultstoppers can help. We've been there. Stay alert for our full site launch coming soon.</p>
